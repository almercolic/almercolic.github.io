#### My journey to GCP
started in February 2020 with joining a project at my workplace at [Lufthansa Industry Solutions](https://www.lufthansa-industry-solutions.com/). With previous project experience in AWS it was an easy switch since the service offerings are in general similar. Initally I found myself mapping a service from GCP to a service from AWS, e.g. Google Cloud Storage --> Amazon S3.

During the project time I had the chance to work with quite a few google services relevant for an Data Engineer. I developed Dataflow pipelines, transferred data in and out of GCS, ingested data into BigQuery, wrote some Cloud Functions and exercised a lot with IAM permissions and roles.

#### Getting certified
After eight months of working with GCP I wanted to get a certification to provide evidence for my knowledge. Finally I've passed the GCP Professional Data Engineer certification and I can call myself a Google Cloud Platform - Professional Data Engineer.

#### Next Steps
I'm working in an complex migration project from Azure to GCP which brought to me more knowledge in GCP services. The next step is to achieve another GCP certification: Google Cloud Platform - Professional Cloud Architect.
